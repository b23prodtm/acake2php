CakePHP for [PHP-CMS Pohse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pohse/) on OpenShift [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/b23prodtm/myphpcms.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/b23prodtm/myphpcms)
===============================

This is a quickstart CakePHP application for OpenShift v3 that you ''can'' use as a starting point to develop your own application and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

If you'd like to install it, follow [these directions](https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex/blob/master/README.md#installation).  

It includes a link to [PHP-CMS Pohse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pohse/) and its [GIT cake-php release](https://bitbucket.org/b23prodtm/php-cms/branch/cake-php). The latter PHP CMS is featuring well-known functionalities as cool as posting some web contents with pictures stored in a database. More features do come thank to the powerful [Cake PHP framework](http://www.cakephp.org).

### Source repository layout

You do not need to change anything in your existing PHP project's repository.
However, if these files exist they will affect the behavior of the build process:

* **submodules**

 Â The myphpcms folder includes modules that need to be pulled in order to install locally.
  After the first checkout browse to myphpcms folder and do
  ```git submodule update --init --recursive```
  You'll see modules populating the subfolder app/webroot/... If something goes wrong, erase the myphpcms folder and start over.

* **composer.json**

  List of dependencies to be installed with `composer`. The format is documented
  [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md).
  Plugins are registered in both _git submodule_ and _composer.json_. To allow a plugin to accept ```composer update```, edit _composer.json_ according to the available released tags. In the plugin's home repository (app/Plugin/<plugin-name>/), call```git tag``` or  ``git log``` for more information.
  >_DEVELOPER TIP:_ To push tags : ```git tag`<version> && git push --tags```.   

### Compatibility

This repository is compatible with PHP 5.6 and higher, excluding any alpha or beta versions.

### Local built-in server
>for local test only

Open a Terminal window:

    ./start_cake.sh

>Ctrl-click the URLs to open them in the browser.
### PHP Unit Test

Open a Terminal window:

    ./test_cake.sh -p <sql-password>

See [below](#common-issues) to allow access on the built-in local server.

### Common Issues

1. How to fix the following error?

Index page displays:

    errno : 1146
    sqlstate : 42S02
    error : Table 'phpcms.info' doesn't exist

Try the following to migrate (update) all database tables, answer 'y' when prompted:

    ./migrate-database.sh -u

2. ACCESS DENIED for user root appears with other information complaining about database connection, what does that mean ?

You probably have modified user privileges on your server:

    mysql -u root
    use mysql;
    grant all on $TEST_DATABASE_NAME.* to '$TEST_DATABASE_USER'@'$TEST_MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST';
    exit
    ./configure.sh -c

This will reset the connection profile in ..etc/ properties file.

3. ACCESS DENIED for root@'127.0.0.1' appears with other information complaining about database connection, what does that mean ?

This looks like a first installation of mysql. You have to secure or reset your mysql root access:

    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
    mysqld --initialize

[Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost. Now import identities.

    brew services restart mysql@5.7
    ./migrate-database.sh -Y -i
    <temporary password>

4. My mysql server's upgraded to another version, what should I do ?

Upgrade your phpcms database within a (secure)shell:

    mysql_upgrade -u root --password=<password>

4. I've made changes to mysql database tables, I've made changes to Config/Schema/myschema.php, as Config/database.php defines it, what should I do ?

Migrate all your tables:

    ./migrate-database.sh -u

Answer 'y' when prompted.

5. How to fix up 'Database connection "Mysql" is missing, or could not be created' ?

Check your environment variable (./Scripts/bootargs.sh or Docker/Pod settings)

    TEST_DATABASE_NAME=cakephp_test

Log in with authorized privileges from a shell prompt:

    mysql -u root --password=<password> cakephp_test

6. How to fix up ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/mysql/mysql.sock' (2) ?

Run the socket fixup script with arguments:

    ./migrate-database.sh -y
    brew services restart mysql@5.7
