CakePHP for [PHP-CMS Pohse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pohse/) on OpenShift
===============================

This is a quickstart CakePHP application for OpenShift v3 that you ''can'' use as a starting point to develop your own application and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

If you'd like to install it, follow [these directions](https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex/blob/master/README.md#installation).  

It includes a link to [PHP-CMS Pohse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pohse/) and its [GIT cake-php release](https://bitbucket.org/b23prodtm/php-cms/branch/cake-php). The latter PHP CMS is featuring well-known functionalities as cool as posting some web contents with pictures stored in a database. More features do come thank to the powerful [Cake PHP framework](http://www.cakephp.org).

### Source repository layout

You do not need to change anything in your existing PHP project's repository.
However, if these files exist they will affect the behavior of the build process:
* **submodules**
 Â The myphpcms folder includes modules that need to be pulled in order to install locally.
  After the first checkout browse to myphpcms folder and do 
  ```git submodule update --init --recursive```
  You'll see modules populating the subfolder app/webroot/... If something goes wrong, erase the myphpcms folder and start over.

* **composer.json**

  List of dependencies to be installed with `composer`. The format is documented
  [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md).

### Compatibility

This repository is compatible with PHP 5.6 and higher, excluding any alpha or beta versions.
